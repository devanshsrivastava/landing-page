		Ahead of the upcoming <span>SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) summit</span>in Qingdao, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou on Tuesday held consultations with Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be back in China for the SCO summit just weeks after his first informal summit with President Xi Jinping in Wuhan.
        India and Pakistan became full members of SCO last year. “The two sides reviewed the follow-up action on the understandings reached at the Wuhan Informal Summit and discussed the agenda for bilateral engagement in the coming months, including the preparations for the forthcoming meeting between the PM and President Jinping at the SCO Summit in Qingdao on June 9-10,” said the Ministry of External Affairs. India recently participated in a SCO meeting in Islamabad on terrorism even as it continues to object to “talks and terror’ with Pakistan.
        India and China have been in discussion for a host of international and regional issues including the situation in Afghanistan.
